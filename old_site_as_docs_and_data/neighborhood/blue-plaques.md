# Blue Plaque History Project

Did you know that F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gerald W. Johnson, President Woodrow Wilson and the Cone Sisters, to name a few, were all once residents of Bolton Hill?

The residential enclave of Bolton Hill rivals in significance Boston's Beacon Hill and New York's Brooklyn Heights, throughout its 150 years attracting some of Baltimore's most distinguished residents. Modeled after London's Blue Plaques, Bolton Hill's current residents have proudly marked the homes of its most distinguished past residents.

The Bolton Hill plaques project, organized by Frank Shivers and Polly Duke and sponsored by residents and the Mt. Royal Improvement Association, celebrates and memorializes those who made important contributions to human welfare, cultural and intellectual life, or history. If you need information or wish to apply for a plaque for your historic home, please contact Polly Duke at 410-669-1818.
