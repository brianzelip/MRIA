# Urban Life and Public Safety

[Baltimore City Crime Data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/browse?category=Crime)

Attention to public safety, a high priority in Bolton Hill, is as much a part of the urban scene as walking to restaurants and theater. The Mount Royal Improvement Association  (MRIA) addresses these issues with an array of programs and resources that are designed to provide the highest degree of safety for residents and visitors.  
Safety programs and services include: Citizens on Patrol (by car) and Walkers Patrol (on foot), both visible crime deterrents. In addition, Bolton Hill E-mail Network (BHEN), the first program of its kind, serves as a quick alert, while Court Watch, the most sophisticated program of its kind, ensures the maximum sentence for anyone arrested in the community. All Bolton Hill safety programs are volunteer-managed and depend on quick and accurate methods of communication.
MRIA safety programs function with the support of city agencies and in partnership with surrounding neighborhoods. The Baltimore Police Department and the Midtown Community Benefits District provide the support and guidance needed to manage the programs. For example, Midtown provides an escort service on call and the Police Department provides the information needed for Court Watch.
