# An Overview of Bolton Hill

Bolton Hill, only 1.5 miles from Baltimore’s world-famous Inner Harbor, and 2 miles from Camden Yards and Ravens Stadium, is a premier neighborhood of about nine blocks by five blocks. The community, consisting of approximately 2,000 residents and several shops, has a rich history and a bright future. Primarily a residential community of single-family homes, Bolton Hill also includes schools, churches, grocery stores, a florist, a video store, restaurants, hardware and drug stores, bed-and-breakfasts, and more.

Bolton Hill’s elegant 19th century row houses set among tree-lined streets and deep, leafy gardens qualified the neighborhood for placement on the National Register of Historic Places. Several enclaves of award-winning contemporary town homes and parks blend with the classic architecture of the larger 19th century community. New Orleans-style balconies are fragrant with flowers and parks with fountains and sculptures are alive with neighbors, art students, dog walkers, and joggers.

Bolton Hill overlooks the monuments, church steeples, and skyscrapers of Baltimore's downtown. As part of the Baltimore Cultural District, Bolton Hill is within walking distance of the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Lyric Opera House, University of Baltimore, Maryland Institute College of Art, and Theatre Project. Neighboring Mt. Vernon with the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Walters Art Gallery, Peabody Conservatory, Antique Row, more shops, and restaurants is a ten minute walk away.

Public transportation includes a light rail Cultural Center stop on Howard Street, the State Center subway stop on Dolphin, a five-minute walk to  Penn Station, and a 20 minute drive to BWI airport, as well as City transit buses along the periphery of the neighborhood.

Bolton Hill's neighborhood association, the Mount Royal Improvement Association, represents the community, increasing the power of our individual voices. It serves as liaison with City departments, addresses concerns of the community, and coordinates communications including the Bolton Hill Bulletin, Bolton Hill E-Mail Network (BHEN), and this web site.
