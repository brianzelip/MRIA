# Real Estate

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Bolton Hill is a collection of houses from different eras set among tree-lined streets and deep, leafy gardens. Contemporary town homes and parks blend with classic 19th century Victorian architecture. Bolton Hill has been described as "Georgetown without crowds. Beacon Hill with elbow room."

Grand Victorian houses, diverse neighbors, proximity to Baltimore's cultural district and mass transit systems, Baltimore's "Walk to Work" program, and an active community association are just a few of the many reasons to consider living in Bolton Hill.

For information about real estate opportunities in Bolton Hill, contact any of the real estate agents that make their homes in the neighborhood.  We're also proud to have a special postings board for rental properties.
